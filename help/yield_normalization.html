Normalization is the process of modifying the numerical range of a set of values. Normalizing crop yield values is a common pre-processing procedure prior to analyzing crop data in either a statistical model or machine learning based analysis. The tool re-scales the crop yield values to a 0.0-1.0 range based on the minimum and maximum values, storing the rescaled yield data in an attribute field (named <code>NORM_YIELD)</code>) in the output vector file (<code>output</code>). The user may also specify custom minimum and maximum yield values (<code>min_yield</code> and <code>max_yield</code>); any crop yield values less than this minimum or larger than the specified maximum will be assigned the boundary values, and will subsequently define the 0.0-1.0 range.</p> <p>The user may also optionally choose to standardize (<code>standardize</code>), rather than normalize the data. See <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/normalization-vs-standardization-quantitative-analysis-a91e8a79cebf">here</a> for a detailed description of the difference between these two data re-scaling methods. With this option, the output yield values (stored in the <code>STD_YIELD</code> field of the output vector attribute table) will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-scores</a>, based on differences from the mean and scaled by the standard deviation.</p> <p>Lastly, the user may optionally specify a search radius (<code>radius</code>), in meters. Without this optional parameter, the normalization of the data will be based on field-scale values (min/max, or mean/std. dev.). However, when a radius value larger than zero is specified, the tool will perform a regional analysis based on the points contained within a local neighbourhood. The radius value should be large enough to ensure that at least three point measurements are contain within the neighbourhood surrounding each point. Warnings will be issued for points for which this condition is not met, and their output values will be set to -99.0. When this warning occurs frequently, you should consider choosing a larger search radius. The following images demonstrate the difference between field-scale and localized normalization of a sample yield data set.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/YieldNormalization1.webp" /></p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/YieldNormalization2.webp" /></p> <p>Like many other tools in the <em>Precision Agriculture</em> toolbox, this tool will work with input vector points files in geographic coordinates (i.e. lat/long), although it is preferable to use a projected coordinate system.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_map">yield_map</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_filter">yield_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#recreate_pass_lines">recreate_pass_lines</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#reconcile_multiple_headers">reconcile_multiple_headers</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#remove_field_edge_points">remove_field_edge_points</a></p>
