Nibble is typically used to replace erroneous sections in a class map. Cells in the mask raster that are either NoData or zero values will be replaced in the input image with their nearest non-masked value. All input raster values in non-mask areas will be unmodified.</p> <p>There are two input parameters that are related to how NoData cells in the input raster are handled during the nibble operation. The use_nodata Boolean determines whether or not input NoData cells, not contained within masked areas, are treated as ordinary values during the nibble. It is False by default, meaning that NoData cells  in the input raster do not extend into nibbled areas. When the nibble_nodata parameter is True, any NoData cells in the input raster that are within the masked area are also NoData in the output raster; when nibble_nodata is False these cells will be nibbled.</p> <h2>See Also:</h2> <p><a href='https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help_wbwpro.html#sieve'>sieve</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def nibble(self, input_raster: Raster, mask: Raster, use_nodata: bool = False, nibble_nodata: bool = True) -&gt; Raster: </code></p>
