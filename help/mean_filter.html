<p>This tool performs a mean filter operation on a raster image. A mean filter, a type of low-pass filter, can be used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image. This can be useful for reducing the noise in an image. This tool utilizes an integral image approach (Crow, 1984) to ensure highly efficient filtering that is invariant to filter size. The algorithm operates by calculating the average value in a moving window centred on each grid cell.  Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the <code>filterx</code> and <code>filtery</code> flags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same in the x and y dimensions, the silent <code>filter</code> flag may be used instead (command-line interface only).</p> <p>Although commonly applied in digital image processing, mean filters are generally considered to be quite harsh, with respect to their impact on the image, compared to other smoothing filters such as the edge-preserving smoothing filters including the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#bilateral_filter">bilateral_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#median_filter">median_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#olympic_filter">olympic_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#edge_preserving_mean_filter">edge_preserving_mean_filter</a> and even <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_filter">gaussian_filter</a>.</p> <p>This tool works with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) images. RGB images are decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity channel. NoData values in the input image are ignored during filtering. NoData values are assigned to all sites beyond the raster.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Crow, F. C. (1984, January). Summed-area tables for texture mapping.
