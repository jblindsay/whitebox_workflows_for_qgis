<p>This tool can be used to reduce vignetting within an image. Vignetting refers to the reduction of image brightness away from the image centre (i.e. the principal point). Vignetting is a radiometric distortion resulting from lens characteristics. The algorithm calculates the brightness value in the output image (BVout) as:</p> <p>BVout = BVin / [cos^n(arctan(d / f))]</p> <p>Where d is the photo-distance from the principal point in millimetres, f is the focal length of the camera, in millimeters, and n is a user-specified parameter. Pixel distances are converted to photo-distances (in millimetres) using the specified image width, i.e. distance between left and right edges (mm). For many cameras, 4.0 is an appropriate value of the n parameter. A second pass of the image is used to rescale the output image so that it possesses the same minimum and maximum values as the input image.</p> <p>If an RGB image is input, the analysis will be performed on the intensity component of the HSI transform.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def correct_vignetting(self, image: Raster, principal_point: Vector, focal_length: float = 304.8, image_width: float = 228.6, n_param: float = 4.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
