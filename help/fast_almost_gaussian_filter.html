<p>The tool is somewhat modified from Dr. Kovesi's original Matlab code in that it works with both greyscale and RGB images (decomposes to HSI and uses the intensity data) and it handles the case of rasters that contain NoData values. This adds complexity to the original 20 additions and 5 multiplications assertion of the original paper.</p> <p>Also note, for small values of sigma (&lt; 1.8), you should probably just use the regular GaussianFilter tool.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>P.
