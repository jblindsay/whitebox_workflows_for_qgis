<p>NoData values in the input image are ignored during the convolution operation. This can lead to unexpected behavior at the edges of images (since the default behavior is to return NoData when addressing cells beyond the grid edge) and where the grid contains interior areas of NoData values. Normalization of kernel weights can be useful for handling the edge effects associated with interior areas of NoData values. When the normalization option is selected, the sum of the cell value-weight product is divided by the sum of the weights on a cell-by-cell basis. Therefore, if the kernel at a particular grid cell contains neighboring cells of NoData values, normalization effectively re-adjusts the weighting to account for the missing data values. Normalization also ensures that the output image will possess values within the range of the input image and allows the user to specify integer value weights in the kernel. However, note that this implies that the sum of weights should equal one. In some cases, alternative sums (e.g. zero) are more appropriate, and as such normalization should not be applied in these cases.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def user_defined_weights_filter(self, raster: Raster, weights: List[List[float]], kernel_center: str = "center", normalize_weights: bool = False) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
