<p>This function can be used to calculate Horton's so-called laws of drainage network composition for a         input stream network. The user must specify an input DEM (which has been suitably hydrologically pre-processed         to remove any topographic depressions) and a raster stream network. The function will output a 4-element          tuple containing the bifurcation ratio (Rb), the length ratio (Rl), the area ratio (Ra), and the slope ratio         (Rs). These indices are related to drainage network geometry and are used in some geomorphological analysis.         The calculation of the ratios is based on the method described by Knighton (1998) Fluvial Forms and Processes:          A New Perspective.</p>
