<p>This image processing tool reduces all polygons in a Boolean raster image to their single-cell wide skeletons. This operation is sometimes called line thinning or skeletonization. In fact, the input image need not be truly Boolean (i.e. contain only 1's and 0's). All non-zero, positive values are considered to be foreground pixels while all zero valued cells are considered background pixels. The <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#remove_spurs">remove_spurs</a> tool is useful for cleaning up an image before performing a line thinning operation.</p> <p>Note: Unlike other filter-based operations in <em>WhiteboxTools</em>, this algorithm can't easily be parallelized because the output raster must be read and written to during the same loop.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#remove_spurs">remove_spurs</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#thicken_raster_line">thicken_raster_line</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def line_thinning(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
