<p>This tools calculates a type of shape complexity index for raster objects, focused on the complexity of the boundary of polygons. The index uses the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#line_thinning">line_thinning</a> tool to estimate a skeletonized network for each input raster polygon. The Boundary Shape Complexity (BSC) index is then calculated as the percentage of the skeletonized network belonging to exterior links. Polygons with more complex boundaries will possess more branching skeletonized networks, with each spur in the boundary possessing a short exterior branch. The two longest exterior links in the network are considered to be part of the main network.  Therefore, polygons of complex shaped boundaries will have a higher percentage of their skeleton networks consisting of exterior links. It is expected that simple convex hulls should have relatively low BSC index values.</p> <p>Objects in the input raster (<code>input</code>) are designated by their unique identifiers. Identifier values should be positive, non-zero whole numbers.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#shape_complexity_index_raster">shape_complexity_index_raster</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#line_thinning">line_thinning</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def boundary_shape_complexity(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
