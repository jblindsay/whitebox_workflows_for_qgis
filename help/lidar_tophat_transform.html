<p>This tool performs a white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-hat_transform">top-hat transform</a> on a LiDAR point cloud (<code>input</code>). A top-hat transform is a common digital image processing operation used for various tasks, such as feature extraction, background equalization, and image enhancement. When applied to a LiDAR point cloud, the white top-hat transform provides an estimate of <em>height above ground</em>, which is useful for modelling the vegetation canopy.</p> <p>As an example, notice that the input point cloud on the top of the image below has a substantial amount of topographic variability. After applying the top-hat transform (bottom point cloud), all of this topographic  variability has been removed and point elevations values effectively become height above ground.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/LidarTophatTransform.png" /></p> <p>The white top-hat transform is defined as the difference between a point's original elevation and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)">opening</a>. The opening operation can be thought of as the local neighbourhood maximum of a previous local minimum surface. The user must specify the size of the neighbourhood using the <code>radius</code> parameter. Setting this parameter can require some experimentation. Generally, it is appropriate to use a radius of a few meters in non-urban landscapes. However, in urban areas, the radius may need to be set much larger, reflective of the size of the largest building.</p> <p>If the input point cloud already has ground points classified, it may be better to use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#height_above_ground">height_above_ground</a>, which simply measures the difference in height between each point and its nearest ground classified point within the search radius.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#height_above_ground">height_above_ground</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#tophat_transform">tophat_transform</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#closing">closing</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#opening">opening</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def lidar_tophat_transform(self, input: Lidar, search_radius: float) -&gt; Lidar: ... </code></p>
