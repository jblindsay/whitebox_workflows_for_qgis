<p>This tool can be used to perform a slope-based classification, or filtering (i.e. removal), of non-ground points within a LiDAR point-cloud. The user must specify the name of the input and output LiDAR files (<code>input</code> and <code>output</code>). Inter-point slopes are compared between pair of points contained within local neighbourhoods of size <code>radius</code>. Neighbourhoods with fewer than the user-specified minimum number of points (<code>min_neighbours</code>) are extended until the minimum point number is equaled or exceeded. Points that are above neighbouring points by the minimum (<code>height_threshold</code>) and have an inter-point slope greater than the user-specifed threshold (<code>slope_threshold</code>) are considered non-ground points and are either optionally (<code>classify</code>) excluded from the output point-cloud or assigned the <em>unclassified</em> (value 1) class value.</p> <p>Slope-based ground-point classification methods suffer from the challenge of uses a constant slope threshold under varying terrain slopes. Some researchers have developed schemes for varying the slope threshold based on underlying terrain slopes. <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#lidar_ground_point_filter">lidar_ground_point_filter</a> instead allow the user to optionally (<code>slope_norm</code>) normalize the underlying terrain (i.e. flatten the terrain) using a white top-hat transform. A constant slope threshold may then be used without contributing to poorer performance under steep topography. Note, that this option, while useful in rugged terrain, is computationally intensive. If the point-cloud is of a relatively flat terrain, this option may be excluded.</p> <p>While this tool is appropriately applied to LiDAR point-clouds, the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#remove_off_terrain_objects">remove_off_terrain_objects</a> tool can be used to remove off-terrain objects from rasterized LiDAR digital elevation models (DEMs).</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Vosselman, G.
