<p>This tool will extract all the features, or parts of features, that overlap with the features of the clip vector file. The clipping operation is one of the most common vector overlay operations in GIS and effectively imposes the boundary of the clip layer on a set of input vector features, or target features. The operation is sometimes likened to a 'cookie-cutter'. The input vector file can be of any feature type (i.e. points, lines, polygons), however, the clip vector must consist of polygons.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#erase">erase</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def clip(self, input: Vector, clip_layer: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
