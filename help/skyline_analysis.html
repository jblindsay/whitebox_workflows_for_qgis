There are two outputs of the analysis, including an HTML report and a vector containing the horizon polygons associated with each observation point. The analysis report includes a summary of key characteristics of the skyline for each point, including the average zenith angle, the average horizon distance, the horizon area, the average skyline elevation, the standard deviation of  skyline elevation, and the sky-view factor. The report will also include two radial charts, including the  zenith angle plot and the horizon distance plot, for each observation point.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/skyline_analysis1.png" /></p> <p>The horizon area vector output traces the skyline and is saved as a PolygonZ shapetype, with z-values  taken from the input DEM surface and measures (M-values) derived from the zenith angle values. This can  be thought of as an approxiate vector viewshed for the observation points, except that a viewshed may  well contain internal occlusions that the horizon polygon does not. Note that it is best to use an  input digital surface model, rather than a bare-earth DEM for this function.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/skyline_analysis2.png" /></p> <p>The user must specify the input DEM and vector points file, the name of the output HTML report (which  will be automatically displayed if verbose=True), the maximum distance (max_dist), the observer height  (observer_hgt_offset), whether the output horizon polygon should of the PolygonZ ShapeType (if set to False the output will be of the PolyLineZ ShapeType), and the azimuth fraction (az_fraction), which determines the angular resolution of the analysis, with a default value of 1.0.</p> <p>Note that the input DEM should use a projected spatial referencing system.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="tool_help_wbwpro.md#sky_view_factor">sky_view_factor</a>, <a href="tool_help_wbwpro.md#average_horizon_distance">average_horizon_distance</a>, <a href="tool_help_wbwpro.md#openness">openness</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#lidar_digital_surface_model">lidar_digital_surface_model</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#horizon_angle">horizon_angle</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def skyline_analysis(self, dem: Raster, points: Vector, output_html_file: str, max_dist: float = float('inf'), observer_hgt_offset: float = 0.0, output_as_polygons: bool = True, az_fraction: float = 1.0) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
