<p>This tool performs a type of adaptive filter on a raster image. An adaptive filter can be used to reduce the level of random noise (shot noise) in an image. The algorithm operates by calculating the average value in a moving window centred on each grid cell. If the absolute difference between the window mean value and the centre grid cell value is beyond a user-defined threshold (<code>threshold</code>), the grid cell in the output image is assigned the mean value, otherwise it is equivalent to the original value. Therefore, the algorithm only modifies the image where grid cell values are substantially different than their neighbouring values.</p> <p>Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using <code>filterx</code> and <code>filtery</code>.  These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mean_filter">mean_filter</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def adaptive_filter(self, raster: Raster, filter_size_x: int = 11, filter_size_y: int = 11, threshold: float = 2.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
