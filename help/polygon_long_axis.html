<p>This tool can be used to map the long axis of polygon features. The long axis is the longer of the two primary axes of the minimum bounding box (MBB), i.e. the smallest box to completely enclose a feature. The long axis is drawn for each polygon in the input vector file such that it passes through the centre point of the MBB. The output file is therefore a vector of simple two-point polylines forming a vector field.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def polygon_long_axis(self, input: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
