<p>This tool converts raster lines features into a vector of the POLYLINE VectorGeometryType. Grid cells associated with line features will contain non-zero, non-NoData cell values. The algorithm requires three passes of the raster. The first pass counts<br /> the number of line neighbours of each line cell; the second pass traces line segments starting from line ends (i.e. line cells with only one neighbouring line cell); lastly, the final pass traces any remaining line segments, which are likely forming closed loops (and therefore do not have line ends).</p> <p>If the line raster contains streams, it is preferable to use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_streams_to_vector">raster_streams_to_vector</a> instead. This tool will use knowledge of flow directions to ensure connections between stream segments at confluence sites, whereas <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_to_vector_lines">raster_to_vector_lines</a> will not.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_to_vector_polygons">raster_to_vector_polygons</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_to_vector_points">raster_to_vector_points</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_streams_to_vector">raster_streams_to_vector</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def raster_to_vector_lines(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
