<p>This tool can be used to map the short axis of polygon features. The short axis is the shorter of the two primary axes of the minimum bounding box (MBB), i.e. the smallest box to completely enclose a feature. The short axis is drawn for each polygon in the input vector file such that it passes through the centre point of the MBB. The output file is therefore a vector of simple two-point polylines forming a vector field.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def polygon_short_axis(self, input: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
