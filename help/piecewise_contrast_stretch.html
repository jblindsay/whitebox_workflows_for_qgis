The input image can be either a single-band image or a colour composite, in which case the contrast stretch will be performed on the intensity values of the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) transform of the colour image. The user must also specify the name of the output image (<code>output</code>) and the break-points that define the piecewise function used to transfer brightness values from the input to the output image. The break-point values are specified as a string parameter (<code>function</code>), with each break-point taking the form of (input value, output proportion); (input value, output proportion); (input value, output proportion), etc. Piecewise functions can have as many break-points as desired, and each break-point should be separated by a semicolon (;). The input values are specifies as brightness values in the same units as the input image (unless it is an input colour composite, in which case the intensity values range from 0 to 1). The output function must be specified as a proportion (from 0 to 1) of the output value range, which is specified by the number of output greytones (<code>greytones</code>). The <code>greytones</code> parameter is ignored if the input image is a colour composite.  Note that there is no need to specify the initial break-point to the piecewise function, as (input min value; 0.0) will be inserted automatically. Similarly, an upper bound of the piecewise function of (input max value; 1.0) will also be inserted automatically.</p> <p>Generally you want to set breakpoints by examining the image histogram. Typically it is desirable to map large unpopulated ranges of input brightness values in the input image onto relatively narrow ranges of the output brightness values (i.e. a shallow sloped segment of the piecewise function), and areas of the histogram that are well populated with pixels in the input image with a larger range of brightness values in the output image (i.e. a steeper slope segment). This will have the effect of reducing the number of tones used to display the under-populated tails of the distribution and spreading out the well-populated regions of the histogram, thereby improving the overall contrast and the visual interpretability of the output image. The flexibility of the piecewise contrast stretch can often provide a very suitable means of significantly improving image quality.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#raster_histogram">raster_histogram</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_contrast_stretch">gaussian_contrast_stretch</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#min_max_contrast_stretch">min_max_contrast_stretch</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#standard_deviation_contrast_stretch">standard_deviation_contrast_stretch</a></p>
