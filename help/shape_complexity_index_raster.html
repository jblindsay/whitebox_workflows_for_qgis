<p>This tools calculates a type of shape complexity index for raster objects. The index is equal to the average number of intersections of the group of vertical and horizontal transects passing through an object. Simple objects will have a shape complexity index of 1.0 and more complex shapes, including those containing numerous holes or are winding in shape, will have higher index values. Objects in the input raster (<code>input</code>) are designated by their unique identifiers. Identifier values should be positive, non-zero whole numbers.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><code>ShapeComplexityIndex</code>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#boundary_shape_complexity">boundary_shape_complexity</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def shape_complexity_index_raster(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
