This classification method uses the mean vectors for each class and calculates the Euclidean distance from each unknown pixel to the class mean vector. Unclassed pixels are then assigned to the nearest class mean. A threshold distance (<code>threshold</code>), expressed in number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-scores</a>, may optionally be used and pixels whose multi-spectral distance is greater than this threshold will not be assigned a class in the output image (<code>output</code>). When a threshold distance is unspecified, all pixels will be assigned to a class.</p> <p>Like all supervised classification methods, this technique relies heavily on proper selection of training data. Training sites are exemplar areas of known and representative land cover type. The algorithm determines the spectral signature of the pixels within each training area, and uses this information to define the mean vector of each class. It is preferable that training sites are based on either field-collected data or fine-resolution reference imagery. In selecting training sites, care should be taken to ensure that they cover the full range of variability within each class. Otherwise the classification accuracy will be impacted. If possible, multiple training sites should be selected for each class. It is also advisable to avoid areas near the edges of land-cover patches, where mixed pixels may impact the purity of training site reflectance values.</p> <p>After selecting training sites, the reflectance values of each land-cover type can be assessed using the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#evaluate_training_sites">evaluate_training_sites</a> tool. In particular, the distribution of reflectance values should ideally be non-overlapping in at least one band of the multi-spectral data set.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#evaluate_training_sites">evaluate_training_sites</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#parallelepiped_classification">parallelepiped_classification</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def min_dist_classification(self, input_rasters: List[Raster], training_data: Vector, class_field_name: str, dist_threshold: float = float('inf')) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
