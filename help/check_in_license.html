<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This tool can be used to check-in a WbW-Pro license. Sometimes a floating-license can be left hanging when a tool experiences an error and fails to check-in correctly. This tool can help with that situation by forcing a check-in operation. For more details, please see: <a href="file:///Users/johnlindsay/Documents/programming/Rust/whitebox_workflows/docs/User%20Manual/wbw-user-manual/book/node_locked_floating_licenses.html">the discussion on node-locked vs floating licenses in the user manual</a>. Note that the floating-license ID parameter is optional and only needs to be entered when it differs from the ID used in the plugin settings.</p>
