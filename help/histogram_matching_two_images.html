<p>This tool alters the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a raster image to match, as closely as possible, the CDF of a reference image. Histogram matching works by first calculating the histograms of the input image (i.e. the image to be adjusted) and the reference image. These histograms are then converted into CDFs. Each grid cell value in the input image is then mapped to the corresponding value in the reference CDF that has the an equivalent (or as close as possible) cumulative probability value. A common application of this is to match the images from two sensors with slightly different responses, or images from the same sensor, but the sensor's response is known to change over time.The size of the two images (rows and columns) do not need to be the same, nor do they need to be geographically overlapping.</p> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_matching_two_images">histogram_matching_two_images</a> is related to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_matching">histogram_matching</a> tool, which can be used when a reference CDF is used directly rather than deriving it from a reference image. <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_equalization">histogram_equalization</a> and <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_contrast_stretch">gaussian_contrast_stretch</a> are similarly related tools, where the reference CDFs are uniform and Gaussian (normal) respectively.</p> <p>The algorithm may introduces gaps in the histograms (steps in the CDF). This is to be expected because the histograms are being distorted. This is more prevalent for integer-level images. Histogram matching is not appropriate for images containing categorical (class) data. It is also not intended for images containing RGB data, in which case, the colour channels should be split using the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#split_colour_composite">split_colour_composite</a> tool.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_matching">histogram_matching</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_equalization">histogram_equalization</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_contrast_stretch">gaussian_contrast_stretch</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#split_colour_composite">split_colour_composite</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def histogram_matching_two_images(self, image1: Raster, image2: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
