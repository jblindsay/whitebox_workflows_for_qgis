The user must specify the name of the input line vector (<code>routes</code>), the input raster digital elevation model file (<code>dem</code>), and the output line vector (<code>output</code>). The algorithm initially splits the input line vector in equal-length segments (<code>length</code>). For each line segment, the tool then calculates the average slope (<strong>AVG_SLOPE</strong>), minimum and maximum elevations (<strong>MIN_ELEV</strong>, <strong>MAX_ELEV</strong>), the elevation range or relief (<strong>RELIEF</strong>), the path sinuosity (<strong>SINUOSITY</strong>), the number of changes in slope direction or breaks-in-slope (<strong>CHG_IN_SLP</strong>), and the maximum visibility (<strong>VISIBILITY</strong>). Each of these metrics are output to the attribute table of the output vector, along with the feature identifier (<strong>FID</strong>); any attributes associated with the input parent feature will also be copied into the output table. Slope and elevation metrics are measured along the 2D path based on the elevations of each of the row and column intersection points of the raster with the path, estimated from linear-interpolation using the two neighbouring elevations on either side of the path. Sinuosity is calculated as the ratio of the along-surface (i.e. 3D) path length, divided by the 3D distance between the start and end points of the segment. CHG_IN_SLP can be thought of as a crude measure of path roughness, although this will be very sensitive to the quality of the DEM. The visibility metric is based on the Yokoyama et al. (2002) <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#openness">openness</a> index, which calculates the average horizon angle in the eight cardal directions to a maximum search distance (<code>dist</code>), measured in grid cells.</p> <p>Note that the input DEM must be in a projected coordinate system. The DEM and the input routes vector must be also share the same coordinate system. This tool also works best when the input DEM is of high quality and fine spatial resolution, such as those derived from LiDAR data sets.</p> <p>Maximum segment visibility: <img alt="" src="./img/AssessRoute_visibility.png" /></p> <p>Average segment slope: <img alt="" src="./img/AssessRoute_avg_slope.png" /></p> <p>For more information about this tool, see <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/what-makes-a-trail-network-difficult/">this</a> blog on the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com"><em>WhiteboxTools</em> homepage</a>.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#split_vector_lines">split_vector_lines</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#openness">openness</a></p>
