<p>This tool can be used to create a bare-earth DEM from a fine-resolution digital surface model. The tool is typically applied to LiDAR DEMs which frequently contain numerous off-terrain objects (OTOs) such as buildings, trees and other vegetation, cars, fences and other anthropogenic objects. The algorithm works by finding and removing steep-sided peaks within the DEM. All peaks within a sub-grid, with a dimension of the user-specified maximum OTO size (<code>filter</code>), in pixels, are identified and removed. Each of the edge cells of the peaks are then examined to see if they have a slope that is less than the user-specified minimum OTO edge slope (<a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#slope">slope</a>) and a back-filling procedure is used. This ensures that OTOs are distinguished from natural topographic features such as hills. The DEM is preprocessed using a white top-hat transform, such that elevations are normalized for the underlying ground surface.</p> <p>Note that this tool is appropriate to apply to rasterized LiDAR DEMs. Use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#lidar_ground_point_filter">lidar_ground_point_filter</a> tool to remove or classify OTOs within a LiDAR point-cloud.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>J.B.
