<p>This tool characterizes the spatial distribution of the average normal vector angular deviation, a measure of surface roughness. Working in the field of 3D printing, Ko et al. (2016) defined a measure of surface roughness based on quantifying the angular deviations in the direction of the normal vector of a real surface from its ideal (i.e. smoothed) form. This measure of surface complexity is therefore in units of degrees. Specifically, roughness is defined in this study as the neighborhood-averaged difference in the normal vectors of the original DEM and a smoothed DEM surface. Smoothed surfaces are derived by applying a Gaussian blur of the same size as the neighborhood (<code>filter</code>).</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#multiscale_roughness">multiscale_roughness</a> tool calculates the same measure of surface roughness, except that it is designed to work with multiple spatial scales.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Ko, M., Kang, H., ulrim Kim, J., Lee, Y., &amp; Hwang, J.
