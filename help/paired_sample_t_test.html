<p>This tool will perform a paired-sample <em>t</em>-test to evaluate whether a significant statistical difference exists between the two rasters. The null hypothesis is that the difference between the paired population means is equal to zero. The paired-samples <em>t</em>-test makes an assumption that the differences between related samples follows a Gaussian distribution. The tool will output a cumulative probability distribution, with a fitted Gaussian, to help users evaluate whether this assumption is violated by the data. If this is the case, the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#wilcoxon_signed_rank_test">wilcoxon_signed_rank_test</a> should be used instead.</p> <p>The user must specify the name of the two input raster images (<code>input1</code> and <code>input2</code>) and the output report HTML file (<code>output</code>). The test can be performed optionally on the entire image or on a random sub-sample of pixel values of a user-specified size (<code>num_samples</code>). In evaluating the significance of the test, it is important to keep in mind that given a sufficiently large sample, extremely small and non-notable differences can be found to be statistically significant. Furthermore statistical significance says nothing about the practical significance of a difference.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#two_sample_ks_test">two_sample_ks_test</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#wilcoxon_signed_rank_test">wilcoxon_signed_rank_test</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def paired_sample_t_test(self, raster1: Raster, raster2: Raster, output_html_file: str, num_samples: int) -&gt; None: ... </code></p>
