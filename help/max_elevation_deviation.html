<p>This tool can be used to calculate the maximum deviation from mean elevation, <em>DEVmax</em> (Lindsay et al. 2015) for each grid cell in a digital elevation model (DEM) across a range specified spatial scales. <em>DEV</em> is an elevation residual index and is essentially equivalent to a local elevation z-score. This attribute measures the <em>relative topographic position</em> as a fraction of local relief, and so is normalized to the local surface roughness. The multi-scaled calculation of <em>DEVmax</em> utilizes an integral image approach (Crow, 1984) to ensure highly efficient filtering that is invariant with filter size, which is the algorithm characteristic that allows for this densely sampled multi-scale analysis. In this way, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#max_elevation_deviation">max_elevation_deviation</a> allows users to estimate the locally optimal scale with which to estimate <em>DEV</em> on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This multi-scaled version of local topographic position can reveal significant terrain characteristics and can aid with soil, vegetation, landform, and other mapping applications that depend on geomorphometric characterization.</p> <p>The user must input a digital elevation model (DEM) (<code>dem</code>). The range of scales that are evaluated in calculating <em>DEVmax</em> are determined by the user-specified <code>min_scale</code>, <code>max_scale</code>, and <code>step</code> parameters. All filter radii between the minimum and maximum scales, increasing by <code>step</code>, will be evaluated. The scale parameters are in units of grid cells and specify kernel size "radii" (<em>r</em>), such that:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>d</em> = 2<em>r</em> + 1</p> </blockquote> <p>That is, a radii of 1, 2, 3... yields a square filters of dimension (<em>d</em>) 3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7...</p> <p><em>DEV</em> is estimated at each tested filter size and every grid cell is assigned the maximum <em>DEV</em> value across the evaluated scales.</p> <p>Two output rasters will be generated, including the magnitude (<em>DEVmax</em>) and a second raster the assigns each pixel the scale at which <em>DEVmax</em> is encountered (<em>DEVscale</em>). The <em>DEVscale</em> raster can be very useful for revealing multi-scale landscape structure.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Lindsay J, Cockburn J, Russell H. 2015.
