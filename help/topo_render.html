The tool simulated direct radiation, diffuse radiation, and light attenuation to create an effective topographic visualization. The user must specify the input digital elevation model (<code>dem</code>) and output (<code>output</code>) file names. One of several named palettes (<code>palette</code>) may also be chosen, including 'atlas', 'high_relief', 'arid', 'soft', 'earthtones', 'muted', 'light_quant', 'purple', 'viridi', 'gn_yl', 'pi_y_g', 'bl_yl_rd', 'deep', 'imhof', and 'white'. The user may optionally reverse the palette (<code>rev_palette</code>), although this will generally not be required since the palettes are designed to work well with topographic data as they are.</p> <p>The user must also specify a number of parameters related to the lighting of the surface. These include the light source direciton (<code>az</code>; 0-360) and altitude (<code>alt</code>; 0-90), both of which describe the 3D light source location in decimal degrees. The light attenuation (<code>attenuation</code>) describes the rate at which the light dims away from the source, effectively applying a gradient across the image. Values of this parameter range from 0-1, with appropriate values in the 0.0 (no attenuation) to 0.7 range. The ambient light parameter (<code>ambient_light</code>) is used to describe how much background (diffuse) light there is, which allows for details to be discernable within shadow areas. Values of this parameter also range from 0-1, although generally much lower values ~0.2, produce good results. Experimentation with each of the lighting parameter values may be needed to create a final map.</p> <p>The resulting output image will have shadows cast beyond the original input DEM's grid, futher creating the illusion of a 3D surface suspended above a background plane (see examples below). The user may accentuate this effect by setting the vertical distance between the topographic surface and the plane (<code>background_hgt_offset</code>). Larger values of this parameter will result in a greater distance, and the parameter values are in the z-units of the input DEM. If the DEM contains NoData values, these sites will appear to cut through to the background plane. In fact, the user may optionally include a clipping polygon (<code>polygon</code>) and only the parts of the DEM that are within this polygon will be displayed. This is useful if, for example, you wish to render an individual watershed. The user may specify the colour of the background plane (<code>background_clr</code>), as a string of RGB or RGBA values, e.g. '[255, 240, 200, 255]'. The default colour is white, which may appear slightly greyed if a non-zero light attentuation value is specified.</p> <p>Lastly, the user must specify an elevation multiplier (<code>z_factor</code>) parameter, with a default of 1.0. This can be useful for applying a vertical exageration (values greater than 1.0) to the elevation surface for enchanced topographic relief. This may be important when applying this tool in relatively low-to-moderate relief locations, or when applying it to very large spatial extents. Please note, this tool is suitable for applying to DEMs in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or projected coordinate systems.</p> <p>The image that is created by this tool is a GeoTiff and can be opened in a GIS. This means that it is possible to overlay other layers on top. For example, it is possible to use the 'white' palette to create a rendered topography and then to overlay, transparently, a satellite image or air photo on top within a GIS. In the case of a fine-resolution image, however, it is important to remember that typically shadows will be visible in these images, that can be contrary to those generated by the rendered topography, which is not ideal for visualization.</p> <p>The following examples demonstrate how the output of this may appear.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/TopoRender1.png" /></p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/TopoRender2.png" /></p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#shadow_image">shadow_image</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#shadow_animation">shadow_animation</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#time_in_daylight">time_in_daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#horizon_angle">horizon_angle</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#hypsometrically_tinted_hillshade">hypsometrically_tinted_hillshade</a></p>
