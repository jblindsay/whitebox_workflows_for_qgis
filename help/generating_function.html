Florinsky (2016) describes generating function as a measure for the deflection of tangential curvature from loci of extreme curvature of the topographic surface. Florinsky (2016) demonstrated the application of this variable for identifying landscape structural lines, i.e. ridges and thalwegs, for which the generating function takes values near zero. Ridges coincide with divergent areas where generating function is approximately zero, while thalwegs are associated with convergent areas with generating function values near zero. This variable has positive values, zero or greater and is measured in units of m<sup>-2</sup>.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/GeneratingFunction.png" /></p> <p>The user must specify the name of the input DEM (<code>dem</code>) and the output raster (<code>output</code>). The The Z conversion factor (<code>zfactor</code>) is only important when the vertical and horizontal units are not the same in the DEM. When this is the case, the algorithm will multiply each elevation in the DEM by the Z Conversion Factor. Raw generating function values are often challenging to visualize given their range and magnitude, and as such the user may opt to log-transform the output raster (<code>log</code>). Transforming the values applies the equation by Shary et al. (2002):</p> <p><em>Θ</em>' = sign(<em>Θ</em>) ln(1 + 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>|<em>Θ</em>|)</p> <p>where <em>Θ</em> is the parameter value and <em>n</em> is dependent on the grid cell size.</p> <p>This tool uses the 3rd-order bivariate Taylor polynomial method described by Florinsky (2016). Based on a polynomial fit of the elevations within the 5x5 neighbourhood surrounding each cell, this method is considered more robust against outlier elevations (noise) than other methods. For DEMs in geographic coordinate systems, however, this tool cannot use the same  3x3 polynomial fitting method for equal angle grids, also described by Florinsky (2016), that is used by the other curvature tools in this software. That is because generating function uses 3rd order partial derivatives, which cannot be calculated using the 9 elevations in a 3x3; more elevation values are required (i.e. a 5x5 window). Thus, this tool uses the same 5x5 method used for DEMs in projected coordinate systems, and calculates the average linear distance between neighbouring cells in the vertical and horizontal directions using the Vincenty distance function. Note that this may cause a notable slow-down in algorithm performance and has a lower accuracy than would be achieved using an equal angle method, because it assumes a square pixel (in linear units).</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>Florinsky, I.
