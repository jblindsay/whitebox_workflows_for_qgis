<p>This tool can be used to assign the Horton stream order to each link in a stream network. Stream ordering is often used in hydro-geomorphic and ecological studies to quantify the relative size and importance of a stream segment to the overall river system. There are several competing stream ordering schemes. Based on to this common stream numbering system, headwater stream links are assigned an order of one. Stream order only increases downstream when two links of equal order join, otherwise the downstream link is assigned the larger of the two link orders.</p> <p>Strahler order and Horton order are similar approaches to assigning stream network hierarchy. Horton stream order essentially starts with the Strahler order scheme, but subsequently replaces each of the assigned stream order value along the main trunk of the network with the order value of the outlet. The main channel is not treated differently compared with other tributaries in the Strahler ordering scheme.</p> <p>The user must specify input a streams raster image (<code>streams_raster</code>) and D8 pointer image (<code>d8_pntr</code>). Stream cells are designated in the streams image as all positive, nonzero values. Thus all non-stream or background grid cells are commonly assigned either zeros or NoData values. The pointer image is used to traverse the stream network and should only be created using the D8 algorithm (<a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#d8_pointer">d8_pointer</a>). Background cells will be assigned the NoData value in the output image, unless the user specifies <code>zero_background=True</code>, in which case non-stream cells will be assigned zero values in the output.</p> <p>By default, the pointer raster is assumed to use the clockwise indexing method used by WhiteboxTools. If the pointer file contains ESRI flow direction values instead, the user must set <code>esri_pntr=True</code>.</p> <h2>Reference Horton, R. E. (1945).
