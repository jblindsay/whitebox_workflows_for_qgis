<p>The terrain ruggedness index (TRI) is a measure of local topographic relief. The TRI calculates the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) for each grid cell in a digital elevation model (DEM), calculating the residuals (i.e. elevation differences) between a grid cell and its eight neighbours. Notice that, unlike the output of this tool, the original Riley et al. (1999) TRI did not normalize for the number of cells in the local window (i.e. it is a root-square-deviation only). However, using the mean has the advantage of allowing for the varying number of neighbouring cells along the grid edges and in areas bordering NoData cells. This modification does however imply that the output of this tool cannot be directly compared with the index ranges of level to extremely rugged terrain provided in Riley et al.
