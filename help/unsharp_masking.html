<p>Unsharp masking is an image edge-sharpening technique commonly applied in digital image processing. Admittedly, the name 'unsharp' seems somewhat counter-intuitive given the purpose of the filter, which is to enchance the definition of edge features within the input image (<code>input</code>). This name comes from the use of a blurred, or unsharpened, intermediate image (mask) in the process. The blurred image is combined with the positive (original) image, creating an image that exhibits enhanced feature definition. A caution is needed in that the output image, although clearer, may be a less accurate representation of the image's subject. The output may also contain more speckle than the input image.</p> <p>In addition to the input (<code>input</code>) and output image files, the user must specify the values of three parameters: the standard deviation distance (<code>sigma</code>), which is a measure of the filter size in pixels, the amount (<code>amount</code>), a percentage value that controls the magnitude of each overshoot at edges, and lastly, the threshold (<code>threshold</code>), which controls the minimal brightness change that will be sharpened. Pixels with values differ after the calculation of the filter by less than the threshold are unmodified in the output image.</p> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#unsharp_masking">unsharp_masking</a> works with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) colour images. RGB images are decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity channel. Importantly, the intensity values range from 0-1, which is important when setting the threshold value for colour images. NoData values in the input image are ignored during processing.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_filter">gaussian_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#high_pass_filter">high_pass_filter</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def unsharp_masking(self, raster: Raster, sigma: float = 0.75, amount: float = 100.0, threshold: float = 0.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
