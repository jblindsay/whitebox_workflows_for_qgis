<p>This can be used to calculate the radius of gyration (RoG) for the polygon features within a raster image. RoG measures how far across the landscape a polygon extends its reach on average, given by the mean distance between cells in a patch (Mcgarigal et al. 2002). The radius of gyration can be considered a measure of the average distance an organism can move within a patch before encountering the patch boundary from a random starting point (Mcgarigal et al. 2002). The input raster grid should contain polygons with unique identifiers greater than zero. The user must also specify the name of the output raster file (where the radius of gyration will be assigned to each feature in the input file) and the specified option of outputting text data.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def radius_of_gyration(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Tuple[Raster, str]: ... </code></p>
