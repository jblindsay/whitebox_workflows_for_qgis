<p>This tool can be used to calculate the viewshed (i.e. the visible area) from a location (i.e. viewing station) or group of locations based on the topography defined by an input digital elevation model (DEM). The user must input a DEM (<code>dem</code>), a viewing station input vector file (<code>stations</code>) and the viewing height (<code>height</code>). Viewing station locations are specified as points within an input shapefile. The output image indicates the number of stations visible from each grid cell. The viewing height is in the same units as the elevations of the DEM and represent a height above the ground elevation from which the viewshed is calculated.</p> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#viewshed">viewshed</a> should be used when there are a relatively small number of target sites for which visibility needs to be assessed. If you need to assess general landscape visibility as a land-surface parameter, the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#visibility_index">visibility_index</a> tool should be used instead.</p> <p>Viewshed analysis is a very computationally intensive task. Depending on the size of the input DEM grid and the number of viewing stations, this operation may take considerable time to complete. Also, this implementation of the viewshed algorithm does not account for the curvature of the Earth. This should be accounted for if viewsheds are being calculated over very extensive areas.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#visibility_index">visibility_index</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def viewshed(self, dem: Raster, station_points: Vector, station_height: float = 2.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
