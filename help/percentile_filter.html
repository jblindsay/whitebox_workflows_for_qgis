<p>This tool calculates the percentile of the center cell in a moving filter window applied to an input image (`input). This indicates the value below which a given percentage of the neighbouring values in within the filter fall. For example, the 35th percentile is the value below which 35% of the neighbouring values in the filter window may be found. As such, the percentile of a pixel value is indicative of the relative location of the site within the statistical distribution of values contained within a filter window. When applied to input digital elevation models, percentile is a measure of local topographic position, or elevation residual.</p> <p>Neighbourhood size, or filter size, is specified in the x and y dimensions using the <code>filterx</code> and <code>filtery</code> flags. These dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9... If the kernel filter size is the same in the x and y dimensions, the silent <code>filter</code> flag may be used instead (command-line interface only).</p> <p>This tool takes advantage of the redundancy between overlapping, neighbouring filters to enhance computationally efficiency, using a method similar to Huang et al. (1979). This efficient method of calculating percentiles requires rounding of floating-point inputs, and therefore the user must specify the number of significant digits (<code>sig_digits</code>) to be used during the processing. Like most of WhiteboxTools' filters, this tool is also parallelized for further efficiency.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Huang, T., Yang, G.J.T.G.Y. and Tang, G., 1979.
