<p>This tool performs a type of edge-preserving mean filter operation on an input image (<code>input</code>). The filter, a type of low-pass filter, can be used to emphasize the longer-range variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the image and to reduce noise in the image. The algorithm calculates the average value in a moving window centred on each grid cell, including in the averaging only the set of neighbouring values for which the absolute value difference with the centre value is less than a specified threshold value (<code>threshold</code>). It is, therefore, similar to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#bilateral_filter">bilateral_filter</a>, except all neighbours within the threshold difference are equally weighted and neighbour distance is not accounted for. Filter kernels are always square, and filter size, is specified using the <code>filter</code> parameter. This dimensions should be odd, positive integer values, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 9...</p> <p>This tool works with both greyscale and red-green-blue (RGB) input images. RGB images are decomposed into intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and the filter is applied to the intensity channel. If an RGB image is input, the threshold value must be in the range 0.0-1.0 (more likely less than 0.15), where a value of 1.0 would result in an ordinary mean filter (<a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mean_filter">mean_filter</a>). NoData values in the input image are ignored during filtering.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mean_filter">mean_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#bilateral_filter">bilateral_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#edge_preserving_mean_filter">edge_preserving_mean_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_filter">gaussian_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#median_filter">median_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#rgb_to_ihs">rgb_to_ihs</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def edge_preserving_mean_filter(self, raster: Raster, filter_size: int = 11, threshold: float = 15.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
