<p>This tool can be used to join (i.e. merge) a vector's attribute table with a second table. The user must specify the name of the vector file (and associated attribute file) as well as the <em>primary key</em> within the table. The <em>primary key</em> (<code>pkey</code> flag) is the field within the table that is being appended to that serves as the identifier. Additionally, the user must specify the name of a second vector from which the data appended into the first table will be derived. The <em>foreign key</em> (<code>fkey</code> flag), the identifying field within the second table that corresponds with the data contained within the primary key in the table, must be specified. Both the primary and foreign keys should either be strings (text) or integer values. <em>Fields containing decimal values are not good candidates for keys.</em> Lastly, the names of the field within the second file to include in the merge operation can also be input (<code>import_field</code>). If the <code>import_field</code> field is not input, all fields in the attribute table of the second file, that are not the foreign key nor FID, will be imported to the first table.</p> <p>Merging works for one-to-one and many-to-one database relations. A <em>one-to-one</em> relations exists when each record in the attribute table corresponds to one record in the second table and each primary key is unique. Since each record in the attribute table is associated with a geospatial feature in the vector, an example of a one-to-one relation may be where the second file contains AREA and PERIMETER fields for each polygon feature in the vector. This is the most basic type of relation. A many-to-one relation would exist when each record in the first attribute table corresponds to one record in the second file and the primary key is NOT unique. Consider as an example a vector and attribute table associated with a world map of countries. Each country has one or more more polygon features in the shapefile, e.g. Canada has its mainland and many hundred large islands. You may want to append a table containing data about the population and area of each country. In this case, the COUNTRY columns in the attribute table and the second file serve as the primary and foreign keys respectively. While there may be many duplicate primary keys (all of those Canadian polygons) each will correspond to only one foreign key containing the population and area data. This is a <em>many-to-one</em> relation.
