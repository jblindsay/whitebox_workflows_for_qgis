<p>This tool can be used to resolve many of the topological errors and inconsistencies associated with manually digitized vector stream networks, i.e. hydrography data. A properly structured stream network should consist of a series of stream segments that connect a channel head to a downstream confluence, or an upstream confluence to a downstream confluence/outlet. This tool will join vector arcs that connect at arbitrary, non-confluence points along stream segments. It also splits an arc where a tributary stream connects at a mid-point, thereby creating a proper confluence where two upstream triburaries converge into a downstream segment. The tool also handles non-connecting tributaries caused by dangling arcs, i.e. overshoots and undershoots.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/RepairStreamVectorTopology.png" /></p> <p>The user must specify the name of the input vector stream network (<code>input</code>) and the output file (<code>output</code>). Additionally, a distance threshold for snapping dangling arcs (<code>snap</code>) must be specified. This distance is in the input layer's x-y units. The tool works best on projected input data, however, if the input are in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), then specifying a small valued snap distance is advisable. Notice that the attributes of the input layer will not be carried over to the output file because there is not a one-for-one feature correspondence between the two files due to the joins and splits of stream segments. Instead the output attribute table will only contain a feature ID (FID) entry.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: this tool should be used to pre-process vector streams that are input to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#vector_stream_network_analysis">vector_stream_network_analysis</a> tool.</p> </blockquote> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#vector_stream_network_analysis">vector_stream_network_analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#fix_dangling_arcs">fix_dangling_arcs</a></p>
