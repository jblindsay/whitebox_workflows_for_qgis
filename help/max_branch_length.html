<p>Maximum branch length (<code>Bmax</code>) is the longest branch length between a grid cell's flowpath and the flowpaths initiated at each of its neighbours. It can be conceptualized as the downslope distance that a volume of water that is split into two portions by a drainage divide would travel before reuniting.</p> <p>If the two flowpaths of neighbouring grid cells do not intersect, <code>Bmax</code> is simply the flowpath length from the starting cell to its terminus at the edge of the grid or a cell with undefined flow direction (i.e. a pit cell either in a topographic depression or at the edge of a major body of water).</p> <p>The pattern of <code>Bmax</code> derived from a DEM should be familiar to anyone who has interpreted upslope contributing area images. In fact, <code>Bmax</code> can be thought of as the complement of upslope contributing area. Whereas contributing area is greatest along valley bottoms and lowest at drainage divides, <code>Bmax</code> is greatest at divides and lowest along channels. The two topographic attributes are also distinguished by their units of measurements; <code>Bmax</code> is a length rather than an area. The presence of a major drainage divide between neighbouring grid cells is apparent in a <code>Bmax</code> image as a linear feature, often two grid cells wide, of relatively high values. This property makes <code>Bmax</code> a useful land surface parameter for mapping ridges and divides.</p> <p><code>Bmax</code> is useful in the study of landscape structure, particularly with respect to drainage patterns. The index gives the relative significance of a specific location along a divide, with respect to the dispersion of materials across the landscape, in much the same way that stream ordering can be used to assess stream size.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/MaxBranchLength_fig1.png" /></p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#flow_length_diff">flow_length_diff</a></p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Lindsay JB, Seibert J. 2013.
