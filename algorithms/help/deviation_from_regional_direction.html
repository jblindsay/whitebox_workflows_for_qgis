<p>This tool calculates the degree to which each polygon in an input shapefile (<code>input</code>) deviates from the average,  or regional, direction. The input file will have a new attribute inserted in the attribute table, <code>DEV_DIR</code>, which will contain the calculated values. The deviation values are in degrees. The orientation of each polygon is determined based on the long-axis of the minimum bounding box fitted to the polygon. The regional direction is based on the  mean direciton of the polygons, weighted by long-axis length (longer polygons contribute more weight) and elongation, i.e., a function of the long and short axis lengths (greater elongation contributes more weight). Polygons with  elongation values lower than the elongation threshold value (<code>elongation_threshold</code>), which has values between 0 and 1,  will be excluded from the calculation of the regional direction. </p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#patch_orientation">patch_orientation</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#elongation_ratio">elongation_ratio</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def deviation_from_regional_direction(self, input: Vector, elongation_threshold: float = 0.75) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
