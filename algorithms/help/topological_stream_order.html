<p>This tool can be used to assign the topological stream order to each link in a stream network. According to this stream numbering system, the link directly draining to the outlet is assigned an order of one. Each of the two tributaries draining to the order-one link are assigned an order of two, and so on until the most distant link from the catchment outlet has been assigned an order. The topological order can therefore be thought of as a measure of the topological distance of each link in the network to the catchment outlet and is likely to be related to travel time.</p> <p>The user must input a streams raster image (<code>streams_raster</code>) and D8 pointer image (<code>d8_pntr</code>). Stream cells are designated in the streams image as all positive, nonzero values. Thus all non-stream or background grid cells are commonly assigned either zeros or NoData values. The pointer image is used to traverse the stream network and should only be created using the D8 algorithm. Background cells will be assigned the NoData value in the output image, unless the <code>zero_background=True</code>, in which case non-stream cells will be assigned zero values in the output.</p> <p>By default, the pointer raster is assumed to use the clockwise indexing method used by WhiteboxTools. If the pointer file contains ESRI flow direction values instead, set <code>esri_pntr=True</code>.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#hack_stream_order">hack_stream_order</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#horton_stream_order">horton_stream_order</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#strahler_stream_order">strahler_stream_order</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#shreve_stream_magnitude">shreve_stream_magnitude</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def topological_stream_order(self, d8_pntr: Raster, streams_raster: Raster, esri_pntr: bool = False, zero_background: bool = False) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
