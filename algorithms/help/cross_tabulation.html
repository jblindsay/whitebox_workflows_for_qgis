<p>This tool can be used to perform a cross-tabulation on two input raster images (<code>i1</code> and <code>i2</code>) containing categorical data, i.e. classes. It will output a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table">contingency table</a> in HTML format (<code>output</code>). A contingency table, also known as a cross tabulation or crosstab, is a type of table that displays the multivariate frequency distribution of the variables. These tables provide a basic picture of the interrelation between two categorical variables and can help find interactions between them. <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cross_tabulation">cross_tabulation</a> can provide useful information about the nature of land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes between two dates of classified multi-spectral satellite imagery. For example, the extent of urban expansion could be described using the information about the extent of pixels in an 'urban' class in Date 2 that were previously assigned to other classes (e.g. agricultural LULC categories) in the Date 1 imagery.</p> <p>Both input images must share the same grid, as the analysis requires a comparison of a pair of images on a cell-by-cell basis. If a grid cell contains a <strong>NoData</strong> value in either of the input images, the cell will be excluded from the analysis.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def cross_tabulation(self, raster1: Raster, raster2: Raster, output_html_file: str) -&gt; None: ... </code></p>
