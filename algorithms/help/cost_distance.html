<p>This tool can be used to perform cost-distance or least-cost pathway analyses. Specifically, this tool can be used to calculate the accumulated cost of traveling from the 'source grid cell' to each other grid cell in a raster dataset. It is based on the costs associated with traveling through each cell along a pathway represented in a cost (or friction) surface. If there are multiple source grid cells, each cell in the resulting cost-accumulation surface will reflect the accumulated cost to the source cell that is connected by the minimum accumulated cost-path. The user must specify the names of the raster file containing the source cells (<code>source</code>), the raster file containing the cost surface information (<code>cost</code>), the output cost-accumulation surface raster (<code>out_accum</code>), and the output back-link raster (<code>out_backlink</code>). Source cells are designated as all positive, non-zero valued grid cells in the source raster. The cost (friction) raster can be created by combining the various cost factors associated with the specific problem (e.g. slope gradient, visibility, etc.) using a raster calculator or the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#weighted_overlay">weighted_overlay</a> tool.</p> <p>While the cost-accumulation surface raster can be helpful for visualizing the three-dimensional characteristics of the 'cost landscape', it is actually the back-link raster that is used as inputs to the other two cost-distance tools, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cost_allocation">cost_allocation</a> and <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cost_pathway">cost_pathway</a>, to determine the least-cost linkages among neighbouring grid cells on the cost surface. If the accumulated cost surface is analogous to a digital elevation model (DEM) then the back-link raster is equivalent to the D8 flow-direction pointer. In fact, it is created in a similar way and uses the same convention for designating 'flow directions' between neighbouring grid cells. The algorithm for the cost distance accumulation operation uses a type of priority-flood method similar to what is used for depression filling and flow accumulation operations.</p> <p>NoData values in the input cost surface image are ignored during processing and assigned NoData values in the outputs. The output cost accumulation raster is of the float data type and continuous data scale.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cost_allocation">cost_allocation</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cost_pathway">cost_pathway</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#weighted_overlay">weighted_overlay</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def cost_distance(self, source: Raster, cost: Raster) -&gt; Tuple[Raster, Raster]: ... </code></p>
