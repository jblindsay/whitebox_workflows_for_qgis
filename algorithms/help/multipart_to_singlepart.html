<p>This tool can be used to convert a vector file containing multi-part features into a vector containing only single-part features. Any multi-part polygons or lines within the input vector file will be split into separate features in the output file, each possessing their own entry in the associated attribute file. For polygon-type vectors, the user may optionally choose to exclude hole-parts from being separated from their containing polygons. That is, with the <code>exclude_holes</code> parameter, hole parts in the input vector will continue to belong to their enclosing polygon in the output vector. The tool will also convert MultiPoint Shapefiles into single Point vectors.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><code>single_part_to_multipart</code></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def multipart_to_singlepart(self, input: Vector, exclude_holes: bool = False) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
