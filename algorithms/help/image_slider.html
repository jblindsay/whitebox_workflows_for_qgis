An image slider is an interactive visualization of two overlapping images, in which the user moves the position of a slider bar to hide or reveal one of the overlapping images. The output (<code>output</code>) is an HTML file. Each of the two input images may be rendered in one of several available palettes. If the input image is a colour composite image, no palette is required. Labels may also be optionally associated with each of the images, displayed in the upper left and right corners. The user must also specify the image height (<code>height</code>) in the output file. Note that the output is simply HTML, CSS, and javascript code, which can be readily embedded in other documents.</p> <p>The following is an example of what the output of this tool looks like. <strong>Click the image for an interactive example.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/WhiteboxTools/samples/sat/rs_slider.html"><img alt="" src="./img/ImageSlider.png" /></a></p>
