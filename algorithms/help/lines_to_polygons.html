<p>This tool converts vector polylines into polygons. Note that this tool will close polygons that are open and will ensure that the first part of an input line is interpreted as the polygon hull and subsequent parts are considered holes. The tool does not examine input lines for line crossings (self intersections), which are topological errors.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#polygons_to_lines">polygons_to_lines</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def lines_to_polygons(self, input: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
