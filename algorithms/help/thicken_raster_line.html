<p>This image processing tool can be used to thicken single-cell wide lines within a raster file along diagonal sections of the lines. Because of the limitation of the raster data format, single-cell wide raster lines can be traversed along diagonal sections without passing through a line grid cell. This causes problems for various raster analysis functions for which lines are intended to be barriers. This tool will thicken raster lines, such that it is impossible to cross a line without passing through a line grid cell. While this can also be achieved using a maximum filter, unlike the filter approach, this tool will result in the smallest possible thickening to achieve the desired result.</p> <p>All non-zero, positive values are considered to be foreground pixels while all zero valued cells or NoData cells are considered background pixels.</p> <p>Note: Unlike other filter-based operations in <em>WhiteboxTools</em>, this algorithm can't easily be parallelized because the output raster must be read and written to during the same loop.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#line_thinning">line_thinning</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def thicken_raster_line(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
