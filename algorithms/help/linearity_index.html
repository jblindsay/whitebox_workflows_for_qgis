<p>This tool calculates the linearity index of polygon features based on a regression analysis. The index is simply the coefficient of determination (r-squared) calculated from a regression analysis of the x and y coordinates of the exterior hull nodes of a vector polygon. Linearity index is a measure of how well a polygon can be described by a straight line. It is a related index to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#elongation_ratio">elongation_ratio</a>, but is more efficient to calculate as it does not require finding the minimum bounding box. The Pearson correlation coefficient between linearity index and the elongation ratio for a large data set of lake polygons in northern Canada was found to be 0.656, suggesting a moderate level of association between the two measures of polygon linearity. Note that this index is not useful for identifying narrow yet sinuous polygons, such as meandering rivers.</p> <p>The only required input is the name of the file. The linearity values calculated for each vector polygon feature will be placed in the accompanying attribute table as a new field (LINEARITY).</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#elongation_ratio">elongation_ratio</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#patch_orientation">patch_orientation</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def linearity_index(self, input: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
