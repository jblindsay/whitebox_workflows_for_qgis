<p>This tool calculates the sediment transport index, or sometimes, length-slope (<em>LS</em>) factor, based on input specific contributing area (<em>A<sub>s</sub></em>, i.e. the upslope contributing area per unit contour length; <code>sca</code>) and slope gradient (&beta;, measured in degrees; <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#slope">slope</a>) rasters. Moore et al. (1991) state that the physical potential for sheet and rill erosion in upland catchments can be evaluated by the product <em>R K LS</em>, a component of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), where <em>R</em> is a rainfall and runoff erosivity factor, <em>K</em> is a soil erodibility factor, and <em>LS</em> is the length-slope factor that accounts for the effects of topography on erosion. To predict erosion at a point in the landscape the LS factor can be written as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>LS</em> = (<em>n</em> + 1)(<em>A<sub>s</sub></em> / 22.13)<sup><em>n</em></sup>(sin(&beta;) / 0.0896)<sup><em>m</em></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>where <em>n</em> = 0.4 (<code>sca_exponent</code>) and <em>m</em> = 1.3 (<code>slope_exponent</code>) in its original formulation.</p> <p>This index is derived from unit stream-power theory and is sometimes used in place of the length-slope factor in the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) for slope lengths less than 100 m and slope less than 14 degrees. Like many hydrological land-surface parameters <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#sediment_transport_index">sediment_transport_index</a> assumes that contributing area is directly related to discharge. Notice that <em>A<sub>s</sub></em> must not be log-transformed prior to being used; <em>A<sub>s</sub></em> is commonly log-transformed to enhance visualization of the data. Also, <em>A<sub>s</sub></em> can be derived using any of the available flow accumulation tools, alghough better results usually result from application of multiple-flow direction algorithms such as <code>DInfFlowAccumulation</code> and <code>FD8FlowAccumulation</code>. The slope raster can be created from the base digital elevation model (DEM) using the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#slope">slope</a> tool. The input images must have the same grid dimensions.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Moore, I. D., Grayson, R. B., and Ladson, A. R. (1991).
