<p>This tool will create a mosaic from two input images. It is similar in operation to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a> tool, however, this tool is the preferred method of mosaicing images when there is significant overlap between the images. For areas of overlap, the feathering method will calculate the output value as a weighted combination of the two input values, where the weights are derived from the squared distance of the pixel to the edge of the data in each of the input raster files. Therefore, less weight is assigned to an image's pixel value where the pixel is very near the edge of the image. Note that the distance is actually calculated to the edge of the grid and not necessarily the edge of the data, which can differ if the image has been rotated during registration.  The result of this feathering method is that the output mosaic image should have very little evidence of the original image edges within the overlapping area.</p> <p>Unlike the Mosaic tool, which can take multiple input images, this tool only accepts two input images. Mosaic is therefore useful when there are many, adjacent or only slightly overlapping images, e.g. for tiled data sets.</p> <p>Users may want to use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_matching">histogram_matching</a> tool prior to mosaicing if the two input images differ significantly in their radiometric properties. i.e. if image contrast differences exist.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#histogram_matching">histogram_matching</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def mosaic_with_feathering(self, image1: Raster, image2: Raster, resampling_method: str = "cc", distance_weight: float = 4.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
