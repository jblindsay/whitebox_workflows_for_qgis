Crop yield data often suffer from high levels of noise do to the nature of how these data are collected. Commercial crop yield monitors on combine haresters are prone to erroneous data for several reasons. Where harvested rows overlap, lower than expected crop yields may be associated with the second overlapping swath because the head of the harvesting equipment is only partially filled. The edges of fields are particularly susceptible to being harvested without a full swath of crop, resulting in anomalous crop yields. The starts of new swaths are also prone to errors, because of the misalignment between the time when the monitor begins recording and the time when grain begins flowing. Sudden changes in harvester speed, either speeing up or slowing down, can also result in anomalous yield measurements.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_filter">yield_filter</a> tool can smooth yield point patterns, particularly accounting for differences among adjacent swath lines. The user must specify the name of the input points shapefile (<code>input</code>), the name of the yield attribute (<code>yield_field</code>), the pass number attribute (<code>pass_field_name</code>), the output file (<code>output</code>), the swatch width (combine head length, <code>width</code>), the threshold value (<code>z_score_threshold</code>), and optionally, minimum and maximum yield values (<code>min_yield</code> and <code>max_yield</code>). If the input vector does not contain a field indicating a unique identifier associated with each swath pass for points, users may use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#recreate_pass_lines">recreate_pass_lines</a> to estimate swath line structures within the yield points. The threshold value, measured in standardized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-scores</a> is used by the tool to determine when a point is replaced by the mean value of nearby points in adjacent swaths. The output vector will contain the smoothed yield data in the attribute table in a field named <code>AVGYIELD</code>.</p> <p>The following images show before and after examples of applying <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_filter">yield_filter</a>:</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/YieldFilter1.png" /></p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/YieldFilter2.png" /></p> <p>For a video tutorial on how to use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#recreate_pass_lines">recreate_pass_lines</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_filter">yield_filter</a> and <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#yield_map">yield_map</a> tools, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYfkcS18qJQ&amp;t=1s">this YouTube video</a>.
