<p>This tool finds approximate solutions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problems</a>,  the goal of which is to identify the shortest route connecting a set of locations. The tool uses an algorithm that applies a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt">2-opt heuristic</a> and a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-opt">3-opt</a> heuristic as a fall-back if the initial approach  takes too long. The user must specify the names of the input points vector (<code>input</code>) and output lines vector file (<code>output</code>), as well as the duration, in seconds, over which the algorithm is allowed to search for improved solutions (<code>duration</code>). The tool works in parallel to find more optimal solutions.</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def travelling_salesman_problem(self, input: Vector, duration: int = 60) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
