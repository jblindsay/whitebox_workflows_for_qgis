<p>This tool can be used to perform a geomorphons landform classification based on an input digital elevation model (<code>dem</code>). The geomorphons concept is based on line-of-sight analysis for the eight topographic profiles in the cardinal directions surrounding each grid cell in the input DEM. The relative sizes of the zenith angle of a profile's maximum elevation angle (i.e. horizon angle) and the nadir angle of a profile's minimum elevation angle are then used to generate a ternary (base-3) digit: 0 when the nadir angle is less than the zenith angle, 1 when the two angles differ by less than a user-defined flatness threshold (<code>threshold</code>), and 2 when the nadir angle is greater than the zenith angle. A ternary number is then derived from the digits assigned to each of the eight profiles, with digits sequenced counter-clockwise from east. This ternary number forms the  geomorphons code assigned to the grid cell. There are 3<sup>8</sup> = 6561 possible codes, although many of these codes are equivalent geomorphons through rotations and reflections. Some of the remaining geomorphons also rarely if ever occur in natural topography. Jasiewicz et al. (2013) identified 10 common landform types by reclassifying related geomorphons codes. The user may choose to output these common forms (<code>forms</code>) rather than the the raw ternary code. These landforms include:</p> <table> <th><td>Value</td><td>Landform Type</td></th> <tr><td>1</td><td>Flat</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Peak (summit)</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>Ridge</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>Shoulder</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Spur (convex)</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>Slope</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>Hollow (concave)</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>Footslope</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>Valley</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>Pit (depression)</td></tr>  </table> <p>One of the main advantages of the geomrophons method is that, being based on minimum/maximum elevation angles, the scale used to estimate the landform type at a site adapts to the surrounding terrain. In principle, choosing a large value of search distance (<code>search</code>) should result in identification of a landform element regardless of its scale.</p> <p>An experimental feature has been added to correct for global inclination. Global inclination biases the flatness threshold angle becasue it is measured relative to the z-axis, especially in locally flat areas. Including the <code>residuals</code> flag "flattens" the input by converting elevation to residuals of a 2-d linear model.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/Geomorphons.jpg" /></p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Jasiewicz, J., and Stepinski, T.
