<p>This tool will transform the values in an input raster image (<code>input</code>) into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-scores</a>. Z-scores are also called standard scores, normal scores, or z-values. A z-score is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated by subtracting the mean from an individual raw value and then dividing the difference by the standard deviation. This conversion process is called <em>standardizing</em> or <em>normalizing</em> and the result is sometimes referred to as a standardized variable. The mean and standard deviation are estimated using all values in the input image except for NoData values. The input image should not have a Boolean or categorical data scale, i.e. it should be on a continuous scale.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#cumulative_distribution">cumulative_distribution</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def z_scores(self, raster: Raster) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
