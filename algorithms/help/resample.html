<p>This tool can be used to modify the grid resolution of one or more rasters. The user specifies the names of one or more input rasters (<code>inputs</code>).  The resolution of the output raster is determined either using a specified <code>cell_size</code> parameter, in which case the output extent is determined by the combined extent of the inputs, or by an optional base raster (<code>base</code>), in which case the output raster spatial extent matches that of the base file. This operation is similar to the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a> tool, except that <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#resample">resample</a> modifies the output resolution. The <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#resample">resample</a> tool may also be used with a single input raster (when the user wants to modify its spatial resolution, whereas, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a> always includes multiple inputs.</p> <p>If the input source images are more extensive than the base image (if optionally specified), these areas will not be represented in the output image. Grid cells in the output image that are not overlapping with any of the input source images will not be assigned the NoData value, which will be the same as the first input image. Grid cells in the output image that overlap with multiple input raster cells will be assigned the last input value in the stack. Thus, the order of input images is important.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def resample(self, input_rasters: List[Raster], cell_size: float = 0.0, base_raster: Raster = None, method: str = "cc") -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
