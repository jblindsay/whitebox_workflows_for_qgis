<p>This tool transforms an input raster image into an integral image, or summed area table. Integral images are the two-dimensional equivalent to a cumulative distribution function. Each pixel contains the sum of all pixels contained within the enclosing rectangle above and to the left of a pixel. Images with a very large number of grid cells will likely experience numerical overflow errors when converted to an integral image. Integral images are used in a wide variety of computer vision and digital image processing applications, including texture mapping. They allow for the efficient calculation of very large filters and are the basis of several of <em>WhiteboxTools</em>'s image filters.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Crow, F. C. (1984, January).
