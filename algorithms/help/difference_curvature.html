Difference curvature is half of the difference between profile and tangential curvatures, sometimes called the vertical and horizontal curvatures (Shary, 1995). This variable has an unbounded range that can take either positive or negative values. Florinsky (2017) states that difference curvature measures the extent to which the relative deceleration of flows (measured by kv) is higher than flow convergence at a given point of the topographic surface. Difference curvature is measured in units of m<sup>-1</sup>.</p> <p><img alt="" src="./img/DifferenceCurvature.png" /></p> <p>The user must specify the name of the input DEM (<code>dem</code>) and the output raster (<code>output</code>). The The Z conversion factor (<code>zfactor</code>) is only important when the vertical and horizontal units are not the same in the DEM. When this is the case, the algorithm will multiply each elevation in the DEM by the Z Conversion Factor. Curvature values are often very small and as such the user may opt to log-transform the output raster (<code>log</code>). Transforming the values applies the equation by Shary et al. (2002):</p> <p><em>Θ</em>' = sign(<em>Θ</em>) ln(1 + 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>|<em>Θ</em>|)</p> <p>where <em>Θ</em> is the parameter value and <em>n</em> is dependent on the grid cell size.</p> <p>For DEMs in projected coordinate systems, the tool uses the 3rd-order bivariate Taylor polynomial method described by Florinsky (2016). Based on a polynomial fit of the elevations within the 5x5 neighbourhood surrounding each cell, this method is considered more robust against outlier elevations (noise) than other methods. For DEMs in geographic coordinate systems (i.e. angular units), the tool uses the 3x3 polynomial fitting method for equal angle grids also described by Florinsky (2016).</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>Florinsky, I.
