<p>This tool delineates the longest flowpaths for a group of subbasins or watersheds. Flowpaths are initiated along drainage divides and continue along the D8-defined flow direction until either the subbasin outlet or DEM edge is encountered. Each input subbasin/watershed will have an associated vector flowpath in the output image. <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#longest_flowpath">longest_flowpath</a> is similar to the <code>r.lfp</code> plugin tool for GRASS GIS. The length of the longest flowpath draining to an outlet is related to the time of concentration, which is a parameter used in certain hydrological models.</p> <p>The user must input the filename of a digital elevation model (DEM), a basins raster, and the output vector. The DEM must be depressionless and should have been pre-processed using the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#breach_depressions_least_cost">breach_depressions_least_cost</a> or <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#fill_depressions">fill_depressions</a> tool. The <em>basins raster</em> must contain features that are delineated by categorical (integer valued) unique identifier values. All non-NoData, non-zero valued grid cells in the basins raster are interpreted as belonging to features. In practice, this tool is usual run using either a single watershed, a group of contiguous non-overlapping watersheds, or a series of nested subbasins. These are often derived using the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#watershed">watershed</a> tool, based on a series of input outlets, or the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#subbasins">subbasins</a> tool, based on an input stream network. If subbasins are input to <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#longest_flowpath">longest_flowpath</a>, each traced flowpath will include only the non-overlapping portions within nested areas. Therefore, this can be a convenient method of delineating the longest flowpath to each bifurcation in a stream network.</p> <p>The output vector file will contain fields in the attribute table that identify the associated basin unique identifier (<em>BASIN</em>), the elevation of the flowpath source point on the divide (<em>UP_ELEV</em>), the elevation of the outlet point (<em>DN_ELEV</em>), the length of the flowpath (<em>LENGTH</em>), and finally, the average slope (<em>AVG_SLOPE</em>) along the flowpath, measured as a percent grade.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#max_upslope_flowpath_length">max_upslope_flowpath_length</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#breach_depressions_least_cost">breach_depressions_least_cost</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#fill_depressions">fill_depressions</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#watershed">watershed</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#subbasins">subbasins</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def longest_flowpath(self, dem: Raster, basins: Raster) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
