<p>This tool can be used to perform a k-means clustering operation on two or more input images (<code>inputs</code>), typically several bands of multi-spectral satellite imagery. The tool creates two outputs, including the classified image (<code>output</code> and a classification HTML report (<code>out_html</code>). The user must specify the number of class (<code>classes</code>), which should be known <em>a priori</em>, and the strategy for initializing class clusters (<code>initialize</code>). The initialization strategies include "diagonal" (clusters are initially located randomly along the multi-dimensional diagonal of spectral space) and "random" (clusters are initially located randomly throughout spectral space). The algorithm will continue updating cluster center locations with each iteration of the process until either the user-specified maximum number of iterations (<code>max_iterations</code>) is reached, or until a stability criteria (<code>class_change</code>) is achieved. The stability criteria is the percent of the total number of pixels in the image that are changed among the class values between consecutive iterations. Lastly, the user must specify the minimum allowable number of pixels in a cluster (<code>min_class_size</code>).</p> <p>Note, each of the input images must have the same number of rows and columns and the same spatial extent because the analysis is performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis. <strong>NoData</strong> values in any of the input images will result in the removal of the corresponding pixel from the analysis.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#modified_k_means_clustering">modified_k_means_clustering</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def k_means_clustering(self, input_rasters: List[Raster], output_html_file: str = "", num_clusters: int = 5, max_iterations: int = 10, percent_changed_threshold: float = 2.0, initialization_mode: str = "dia", min_class_size: int = 10) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
