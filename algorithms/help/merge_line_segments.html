<p>Vector lines can sometimes contain two features that are connected by a shared end vertex. This tool identifies connected line features in an input vector file (<code>input</code>) and merges them in the output file (<code>output</code>). Two line features are merged if their ends are coincident, and are not coincident with any other feature (i.e. a bifurcation junction). End vertices are considered to be coincident if they are within the specified snap distance (<code>snap</code>).</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#split_with_lines">split_with_lines</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def merge_line_segments(self, input: Vector, snap_tolerance: float = 2.220446049250313e-16) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
