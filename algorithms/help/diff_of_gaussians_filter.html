<p>This tool can be used to perform a difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filter on a raster image. In digital image processing, DoG is a feature enhancement algorithm that involves the subtraction of one blurred version of an image from another, less blurred version of the original. The blurred images are obtained by applying filters with Gaussian-weighted kernels of differing standard deviations to the input image (<code>input</code>). Blurring an image using a Gaussian-weighted kernel suppresses high-frequency spatial information and emphasizes lower-frequency variation. Subtracting one blurred image from the other preserves spatial information that lies between the range of frequencies that are preserved in the two blurred images. Thus, the difference-of-Gaussians is a band-pass filter that discards all but a specified range of spatial frequencies that are present in the original image.</p> <p>The algorithm operates by differencing the results of convolving two kernels of weights with each grid cell and its neighbours in an image. The weights of the convolution kernels are determined by the 2-dimensional Gaussian (i.e. normal) curve, which gives stronger weighting to cells nearer the kernel centre. The size of the two convolution kernels are determined by setting the two standard deviation parameters (<code>sigma1</code> and <code>sigma2</code>); the larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. The second standard deviation should be a larger value than the first, however if this is not the case, the tool will automatically swap the two parameters. Both standard deviations can range from 0.5-20.</p> <p>The difference-of-Gaussians filter can be used to emphasize edges present in an image. Other edge-sharpening filters also operate by enhancing high-frequency detail, but because random noise also has a high spatial frequency, many of these sharpening filters tend to enhance noise, which can be an undesirable artifact. The difference-of-Gaussians filter can remove high-frequency noise while emphasizing edges. This filter can, however, reduce overall image contrast.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#gaussian_filter">gaussian_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#fast_almost_gaussian_filter">fast_almost_gaussian_filter</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#laplacian_filter">laplacian_filter</a>, LaplacianOfGaussianFilter`</p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def diff_of_gaussians_filter(self, raster: Raster, sigma1: float = 2.0, sigma2: float = 4.0) -&gt; Raster: ... </code></p>
