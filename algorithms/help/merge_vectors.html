<p>Combines two or more input vectors of the same ShapeType creating a single, new output vector. Importantly, the attribute table of the output vector will contain the ubiquitous file-specific FID, the parent file name, the parent FID, and the list of attribute fields that are shared among each of the input files. For a field to be considered common between tables, it must have the same <code>name</code> and <code>field_type</code> (i.e. data type and precision).</p> <p>Overlapping features will not be identified nor handled in the merging. If you have significant areas of overlap, it is advisable to use one of the vector overlay tools instead.</p> <p>The difference between <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#merge_vectors">merge_vectors</a> and the <code>Append</code> tool is that merging takes two or more files and creates one new file containing the features of all inputs, and <code>Append</code> places the features of a single vector into another existing (appended) vector.</p> <p>This tool only operates on vector files. Use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a> tool to combine raster data.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><code>Append</code>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#mosaic">mosaic</a></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def merge_vectors(self, input_vectors: List[Vector]) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
