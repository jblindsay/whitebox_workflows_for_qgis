<p>This modified k-means algorithm is similar to that described by Mather and Koch (2011). The main difference between the traditional k-means and this technique is that the user does not need to specify the desired number of classes/clusters prior to running the tool. Instead, the algorithm initializes with a very liberal overestimate of the number of classes and then merges classes that have cluster centres that are separated by less than a user-defined threshold. The main difference between this algorithm and the ISODATA technique is that clusters can not be broken apart into two smaller clusters.</p> <h2>Reference</h2> <p>Mather, P. M., &amp; Koch, M.
