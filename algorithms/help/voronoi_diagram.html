<p>This tool creates a vector Voronoi diagram for a set of vector points. The Voronoi diagram is the dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation. The tool operates by first constructing the Delaunay triangulation and then connecting the circumcenters of each triangle. Each Voronoi cell contains one point of the input vector points. All locations within the cell are nearer to the contained point than any other input point.</p> <p>A dense frame of 'ghost' (hidden) points is inserted around the input point set to limit the spatial extent of the diagram. The frame is set back from the bounding box of the input points by 2 x the average point  spacing. The polygons of these ghost points are not output, however, points that are situated along the edges of the data will have somewhat rounded (paraboloic) exterior boundaries as a result of this edge condition. If this property is unacceptable for application, clipping the Voronoi diagram to the convex hull may be a better alternative.</p> <p>This tool works on vector input data only. If a Voronoi diagram is needed to tessellate regions associated with a set of raster points, use the <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#euclidean_allocation">euclidean_allocation</a> tool instead. To use Voronoi diagrams for gridding data (i.e. raster interpolation), use the <code>NearestNeighbourGridding</code> tool.</p> <h2>See Also</h2> <p><a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#construct_vector_tin">construct_vector_tin</a>, <a href="https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/tool_help.html#euclidean_allocation">euclidean_allocation</a>, <code>NearestNeighbourGridding</code></p> <h2>Function Signature</h2> <p><code>def voronoi_diagram(self, input_points: Vector) -&gt; Vector: ... </code></p>
